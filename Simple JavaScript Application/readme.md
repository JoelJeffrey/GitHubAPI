# Overview #

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.

There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.

## Requirements ##

1. You can only edit app.js, you cannot touch index.html. jQuery is provided, but is optional.
2. index.html contains two elements: one for the search term and one for the results.
3. The results should show as a list with each item in an "owner/name" format.
4. When a result is clicked, display an alert with the repo's `language`, `followers`, `url` and `description`.
5. The search term should be cached so duplicate searches do not trigger further requests to Github. 

## Notes ##
- Styling is optional, be creative if you so desire, but dont break requirement #1
- Solution does not need to support older browsers.
- Take as much (or little) time as you like, there is no time requirement or expectation.
- Code quality is just as important as a functional app.
